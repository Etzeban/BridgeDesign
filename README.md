<h1>Design a brigde made of Acrylic</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Project Manager in a team of 3 students to design to analyze the loading conditions of a simple bridge and redesign the bridge such that it can bear the loading requirements. Responsible for project management, keep the project aligns with requirements, assembling and testing the bridge.
<br />
The loading requirements stipulated below:
<br />
1. The bridge shall span a chasm that measures 500 mm from one edge to the other.
<br />
2. The bridge shall be made entirely of Acrylic and held together by glue. No mechanical fastener shall be allowed.
<br />
3. The bridge shall have guard rails and allow for 1 way traffic. The traffic will be for 2 PAScars. The guard rails should be implemented for the 500 mm unsupported length only.
<br />
4. The combined load of these PAScars shall be 8 kg maximum. The bridge's allowable stress is recommended to have a tensile safety factor of 1.5 when under this load.
<br />
5. The bridge shall not be damaged or disintegrated in any way as the PAScars travel through it (multiple times).
<br />
6. The maximum deflection point on the bridge shall not prevent the PAScar from crossing it or be more than 5 mm as the PAScars travel through it, whichever is lesser.
<br />
7. The bridge shall connect seamlessly into the 1.2 meters PASCO dynamics track at both ends.
<br />
8. The bridge shall only be fix-supported at 1 end. The fix-support shall be done by 2 hand-clamps at the first 100 mm length of the bridge (without any guard rail). No human contact shall be permitted to provide support for the bridge.
<br />
9. The bridge shall bear permanent markings to identify which team it belongs to. Failure to do so could lead to your bridge being lost and you will receive no credit for the demonstration.
